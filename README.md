# Bookmarkify

Transforms books and its bookmarks into a single webpage.

Supports @voice from android and is easily extensible for other applications.

Just put 1 book per folder in bookmarkify-data, and create a folder `bookmarkify-output`.

```
	var mainPathInput = @"H:\Projects\bookmarkify-data";
	var mainPathOutput = @"H:\Projects\bookmarkify-output";
```
